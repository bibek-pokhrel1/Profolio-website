    <p style="text-align: justify;">
     Even though the technology infrastructure of mobile payments in Nepal has increased substantially
      over the recent years, uptake of mobile wallets among rural districts is surprisingly poor.
       This work explores the infrastructural, socio-cultural, economic drivers behind rural
        communities overarching strong preference towards physical cash. Using a combination of methods,
         the research leans on 100 surveys and 25 interviews culled from five geographically diverse and infrastructurally 
         different districts. Findings, calculated based on thematic coding and the Technology
          Acceptance Model (TAM), illustrate an interconnected web of illiteracy with digital technology,
           trust factors, language restrictions, and limited access to steady internet and power. 
           The research also finds that important regional and demographic variations occur in adoption practices,
            challenging the tradition of writing off rural Nepal as a uniform category. 
            By incorporating local accounts as well as positive deviant cases, the research displays a culturally 
            sophisticated vision of digital resistance. The article concludes with pragmatic policy recommendations
             for policymakers and financial service providers for supporting inclusive digital ecosystems.
      Limitations and avenues for future research are mentioned.
